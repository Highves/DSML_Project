# The first loop accesses the attributes within the SeqRecord object (such as other objects).

# The SeqIO.parse function turns the "your_genome.gbk" file into a SeqRecord object so we can access the information in this record. SeqRecord object holds a sequence (as a Seq object) and identifiers (ID and name), description and optionally annotation and sub-features. 

# The second loop accesses the attributes in the "features" object.

# The "features" object is iterable and contains data for each annotation, such as gene name or location. However, if an annotation does not contain such information the iteration stops. The try, except and continue statement ensures iteration continues even if exceptions to the loop conditions are encountered.
